#**Behavioral Cloning**

This project is Udacity [Self-Driving Car Nanodegree] (https://www.udacity.com/drive). The goal of the project is to complete all the track provided by the simulator, and the code written by it satisfies this. The structure of the used DNN was VGG16, and the acquired data was used the training mode of the simulator. For the simulator provided by Udacity, see [section](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim). The data used here was obtained directly using the ps4 controller.

The model runs as shown below.

Track 1                       |  Track 2
